# absORB
Become the biggest
Objective: Become the biggest. 
You are one of many motes floating around in an empty space, with no goal other than to grow. You move around by ejecting a small amount of matter in one direction to cause an equal and opposite force to push you around in the void. There are 3 planned modes detailed below:
1. Become The Biggest - default gamemode where all motes act the same way. Red motes are too big for you to absorb, while the blue ones are smaller than you. If your mote runs into a blue mote it absorbs the mass of the smaller mote and you grow, but if you bump into a red mote you will get absorbed and have to restart.
2. Anti-mote - Introducing an Artificial Intelligence to a mote (colored purple) whose only goal is to absorb you. Being the life loving little blue circle you are, your only option and only objective is to absorb the Anti-mote for the sake of the void you live in.
3. Orbital - Gravity is now a real problem. A new mote - the Center - is a supermassive mote that is orbited by all the other motes in the level. What's the objective, you ask? Become The Center; absorb so many other motes that you become the new largest force if attraction in the level, and absorb the Center.
