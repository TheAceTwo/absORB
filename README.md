# absORB
AbsORB is a puzzle game where your goal is to absorb the motes in each level until you are the biggest. When you click, a small chunk of your mote is ejected out into the world, which propels you around the level. The smarter player clicks less often; the more motes you eject, the smaller you become. There are 4 different types of motes aside from the player:

Red Motes - red motes are too large for you to absorb. If you run into one, it will absorb you!
Blue Motes - these motes are smaller than you. absorbing smaller motes makes you grow.
Anti-Motes - the Anti-Motes, denoted by their strong green luminescence, just aimlessly float around just like the Blue Motes, with one big exception: These motes don't go out without a fight. When you collide with an Anti-Mote - no matter their size - they try to absorb you. If you're the larger mote then the size of the Anti-Mote's mass is taken from your mote, but if they are the larger mote, you're in real trouble!
Living Motes - the purple motes populate the later levels, and can move around just like you! These living motes will try and absorb smaller motes and battle you for the title of largest mote. In other words, your goal is to absorb the living motes before the living motes absorb you!
Cores - Cores act like a star in a galaxy where everything else orbits around them. The Core spawns in the center of its level, and pulls all the other motes around it in a giant orbital circle. Whenever you see a Core, your objective is to absorb it and become the center of your own mote-galaxy.
